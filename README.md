# Analysis-of-FAAC-Allocation-across-States-in-Nigeria (2020 -2024)
## Project Overview
This project analyzes monthly FAAC (Federation Account Allocation Committee) disbursements to Nigerian states from January 2020 to December 2024, uncovering fiscal trends and regional disparities in revenue distribution.
## Data Source
The data used for this project was sourced directly from the official website of the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC). It comprises monthly allocation figures disbursed to each of the 36 states across Nigeria, spanning from January 2020 to the most recent data in 2024. This dataset includes information such as the type of allocation (e.g., statutory, exchange gain, VAT), the exact amount disbursed to each state per month, and the total net allocations, making it suitable for indepth analysis over time and across geopolitical zones.
## Tools
- Excel
- Power BI
## Data Preparation
- Converted FAAC PDF reports to Excel and cleaned formatting (resized columns, adjusted content layout).
- Extracted relevant data into new sheet containig structured columns: Year, Month, State, Allocation Type, Amount, and Total.
- Removed non-state entries (e.g., Suko Derivation, HYPPADEC).
- Standardized columns like amounth, month, etc (e.g., January → Jan) and removed duplicates.
- Grouped states into Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones for comparative analysis.
- Added a Total Net Amount field to identify and filter overall allocations per state/month.

- Which states received the highest and lowest total allocations?
- How do allocations vary across quarters and years?
- What are the quarterly allocation patterns?
