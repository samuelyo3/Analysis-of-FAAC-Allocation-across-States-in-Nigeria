# Analysis-of-FAAC-Allocation-across-States-in-Nigeria (2020 -2024)
## Project Overview
This project analyzes monthly FAAC (Federation Account Allocation Committee) disbursements to Nigerian states from January 2020 to December 2024, uncovering fiscal trends and regional disparities in revenue distribution.
## Data Source
The data used for this project was sourced directly from the official website of the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC). It comprises monthly allocation figures disbursed to each of the 36 states across Nigeria, spanning from January 2020 to the most recent data in 2024. This dataset includes information such as the type of allocation (e.g., statutory, exchange gain, VAT), the exact amount disbursed to each state per month, and the total net allocations, making it suitable for indepth analysis over time and across geopolitical zones.
## Tools
- Excel
- Power BI
## Data Preparation
- Converted FAAC PDF reports to Excel and cleaned formatting (resized columns, adjusted content layout).
- Extracted relevant data into new sheet containig structured columns: Year, Month, State, Allocation Type, Amount, and Total.
- Removed non-state entries (e.g., Suko Derivation, HYPPADEC).
- Standardized columns like amounth, month, etc (e.g., January → Jan) and removed duplicates.
- Grouped states into Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones for comparative analysis.
- Added a Total Net Amount field to identify and filter overall allocations per state/month.
## EDA Questions
- Which states received the highest and lowest total allocations?
- How do allocations vary across quarters and years?
- What are the quarterly allocation patterns?
- What is the year-over-year (YoY) growth trend?
- How are funds distributed across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones?
- Which states receive the highest statutory allocations?
## Analysis
- Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) including total allocations, Avg allocations, Net VAT, Net Statutory Allocations, 13% Derivations and Number of states.
- Charts were created to provide insights/solutions to EDA.
## Key Insights
- Delta State received the highest total net FAAC allocation during the period, amounting to ₦1.87 trillion, followed by Rivers and Akwa Ibom. In contrast, Cross River received the lowest allocation, followed by Osun.
- In the North Central, North West, and North East zones, VAT contributed the largest share of FAAC allocations, followed by Statutory Allocations and Exchange Gain, with no 13% Derivation received, as these regions are non-oil-producing.
- In the South, allocation patterns shift due to oil production: the South South receives the highest Statutory Allocation (₦3.42T) and 13% Derivation (₦3.14T); the South East shows smaller Derivation and Ecology inflows; while the South West sees VAT as dominant (₦2.07T), followed by Exchange Gain and Statutory Allocation, showing the financial benefits of natural resources.
- Allocations peaked in November, followed by December, July, and June, positioning Q4 as the highest-earning quarter overall, likely influenced by end-of-year fiscal activities. Q3 followed closely, while Q2 trailed behind. February recorded the lowest allocation, with March slightly ahead.
